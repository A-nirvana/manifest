# Quick start guide

CASE allows you to quickly launch a reliable and flexible ERP. If you want to project yourself immediately into the product or simply create your ERP quickly, you can rely on us.

## Prerequisites

The installation requires the following software to be already installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run your environment: only LTS versions are supported (v14 and v16). Other versions of Node.js may not be compatible with the latest release of CASE. The 16.x version is most recommended.
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) to run the CLI installation scripts: (v6 only).

## Section A: Create a new project with CASE Starter

CASE starter covers many use cases (ERP, dashboards, CRM, Custom software, Analytic platform). For now, CASE works only with npm, nodejs and Angular.

### Step 1: Install CASE CLI

```
npm i -g @case-app/case-cli
```

### Step 2: Create a new CASE projet

Run the following command:

```sh
case-app new
```

During the installation, the terminal will ask you **what is the name of your application**. Type `my-case-project`

The CLI will create a monorepo and install dependencies.

### Step 3: Run your project

```sh
cd my-case-project

#1st terminal window
npm run start:client

#2nd terminal window
npm run start:server
```

The frontend server will run here => http://localhost:4200
The backend server will run here => http://localhost:3000

For now, you can go to the login page of your project http://localhost:4200/ but you still can not connect to the platform.

We will seed the data to add users including your CASE admin user.

### Step 4: Seed the data

To generate a bunch of dummy data for all exisiting entities (Users and roles) run the following command:

```sh
npm run seed
```

### Step 5: sign in and have a look at your ERP

Once the seed is finished, you can access to your product via the browser. You will land to the login page. Use your CASE adminâ€™s user credentials to log in.

> Use the email `admin@case.app` and password `case` to log in.
