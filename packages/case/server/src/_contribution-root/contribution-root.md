# Contribution mode app root folder

This folder mocks the root folder in **CASE STARTER** project. When contributing to the package (contributionMode = true), you can develop without having to use the CASE starter package as this folder will replicate the root folder in your case project.

- `/entities`: your classic "entities folder"
- `/public`: public folder for storage and assets
- `app-config.ts`: your app config variables
